Above we have the results of sentiment analysis on a 100 document corpus. 
•	The results in the first panel show the distribution of documents to sentiment results in bar chart form.
•	The second panel shows the distribution in a pie chart format
•	The third panel shows the first 15 documents in the file, the first 10 words, the sentiment integer result(0,1,2), and the string version of that result(neutral, negative, positive) that the document has been assigned.
The user then has the option of downloading the results in a CSV file or saving a copy to storage.
