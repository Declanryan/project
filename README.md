DOCU-SORT.

An application of machine learning for document  processing.

A web application that leverages transfer learning to create a document processing site. This project investigates the use of machine learning techniques specifically in the domain of N.L.P. that can perform document summarization, sentiment analysis, topic extraction and classification, and data extraction, on a given corpus.

The user chooses the required feature but must be registered and logged in to proceed.
 
The user selects the file type to upload.
 
The user uploads files or proceeds to file preview and selection.
 
The user views the uploaded files and selects the required ones.
 



The user previews the selected data and decides to activate the sentiment analysis or to return to file selection.
 


After the analysis is complete the user selects the view result and is brought to the result screen
 
The results of the analysis are displayed.
 
Above we have the results of sentiment analysis on a 100 document corpus. 
•	The results in the first panel show the distribution of documents to sentiment results in bar chart form.
•	The second panel shows the distribution in a pie chart format
•	The third panel shows the first 15 documents in the file, the first 10 words, the sentiment integer result(0,1,2), and the string version of that result(neutral, negative, positive) that the document has been assigned.
The user then has the option of downloading the results in a CSV file or saving a copy to storage.
